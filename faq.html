<b>Q: What is MOBIUS?<br />
A:</b> MOBIUS is a consortium of academic libraries with fifty member colleges
and universities in the state of Missouri. The largest single project for
which MOBIUS is responsible is The Common Library Platform project. The
CLP creates a virtual collection of the approximately 14 million items in
the libraries of Missouri's colleges and universities and creates a
single user interface that allows faculty and students to request library
materials using any personal computer in any location with access to the
Internet. Requested materials are delivered within one or two days of
being requested by the MOBIUS Delivery System. <a href=
